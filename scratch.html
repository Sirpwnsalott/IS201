        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Beautiful Storytelling</li>
            <li>Sci-fi/Space Exploration
                <ul>
                    <li>Planets to explore</li>
                    <li>Mysteries to solve</li>
                    <li>Amazing Ambience</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Knowledge is your only obstacle</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This game is truly one of a kind. It has been and likely always will be my favorite game, due to the way it presents its stories, its mysteries in such a compelling way as to drive my curiosity closer and closer to its final answers. My only regret is that I can never play this for the first time again, as the only thing stopping you from beating the game is a lack of knowledge, and solving the mysteries and understanding the solar system the game takes place in is truly mesmerizing and captivating. If anyone plays this for the first time, do not spoil any of it for yourself through the internet, or look up any guides, its all part of the experience, and any outside knowledge not from you will ruin it.</p>    </div>
